## Overview
This repository is a collection of projects, which you can find in the "Projects" folder. Each project is independent and should run on a standard Arduino / ESP board according to the instructions in the "ReadMe" of the project.

## Project structure
Every project has a "README.md" file which has the bellow information:
* Project's aim
* Features
* Software and code
* Hardware
* Technologies
* Known issues
* Documentation
* Project's status

## Software and code
Every project has its source code in the relevant folder.

## Additional Libraries
Some of the projects use "include" for additional libraries. The user can install the desired libraries using Arduino IDE, or use the "Libraries" folder and copy the needed library to the "library" default location: http://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries

## Hardware
* Boards - In case it does not mention otherwise, the board is Arduino Uno. 
In some cases, I used ESP8266 which interacts with Arduino, after mentioning it in the folder's name.
* Peripherals - Some of the projects use specific peripherals. The documentation and the circuit can be found in the "documentation" folder of the relevant project

## Repository status
In Progress - Although some of the projects are done, or in "Beta" status, this repository is in progress to meet all the required information requirements, as described here.
