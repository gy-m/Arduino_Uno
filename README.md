## Overview
This Repository consist of two main parts:
1. Components - Those are independent files that can be burned to the board and have specific hardware components that are in use.
2. Projects - A collection of programs, dependant on the number of components, which are part of a general project.

## Project structure
Every project has a "README.md" file which has the bellow information:
* Project's aim
* Features
* Software and code
* Hardware
* Technologies
* Known issues
* Documentation
* Project's status

## Software and code
Every project has its source code in the relevant folder.

## Hardware
* Boards - In case it does not mention otherwise, the board is Arduino Uno. 
In some cases, I used ESP8266 which interacts with Arduino, after mentioning it in the folder's name.
* Peripherals - Some of the projects use specific peripherals. The documentation and the circuit can be found in the "documentation" folder of the relevant project

## Repository status
In Progress - Although some of the projects are done, or in "Beta" status, this repository is in progress to meet all the required information requirements, as described here.
